# CYNIC 36 Dimensions — Reference

> 5 Axioms × 7 Dimensions = 35 named + 1 META = 36 total
> φ generates all: 5=F(5), 7=L(4), 36=6²

## Universal Weight Template (per axiom)

Every axiom's 7 dimensions follow this φ-derived weight pattern:

| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weight | φ (1.618) | φ⁻¹ (0.618) | 1.0 | φ (1.618) | φ⁻² (0.382) | φ⁻¹ (0.618) | φ⁻¹ (0.618) |

| 21 | CONSENSUS | φ⁻¹ | Collectively witnessed truth |

## CULTURE — Wood / Yetzirah / Icosahedron ⛩

*"Culture is a moat"*

| # | Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 22 | AUTHENTICITY | φ | Genuine and original |
| 23 | RESONANCE | φ⁻¹ | Memetic propagation — connects emotionally |

## BURN — Fire / Assiah / Tetrahedron 🔥

*"Don't extract, burn"*

| # | Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 29 | UTILITY | φ | Practical usefulness |
| 30 | SUSTAINABILITY | φ⁻¹ | Long-term viability (self-renewal) |
| 31 | EFFICIENCY | 1.0 | Work-to-heat ratio (η) |
| 32 | VALUE_CREATION | φ | Creates more than consumes |
| 33 | SACRIFICE | φ⁻² | Genuine cost borne — skin in the game |
| 34 | CONTRIBUTION | φ⁻¹ | Gives back to ecosystem |
| 35 | IRREVERSIBILITY | φ⁻¹ | Finality of commitment — entropy's arrow |

## META — The 36th Dimension

| # | Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 36 | THE_UNNAMEABLE | φ | Explained variance — what 35 dimensions capture |

Formula: `score = 100 × (1 - normalizedStdDev)` where stdDev measures score variance.
Threshold: 38.2 (φ⁻² × 100) — below this, the residual is anomalous.

## Scoring

Each dimension: 0 (terrible) to 100 (excellent).

**Q-Score Formula:**
```
axiom_score = weighted_avg(7 dimension scores)
Q = 100 × ⁵√(F × Φ × V × C × B / 100⁵)
```

Geometric mean: one weak axiom drags Q down. You cannot compensate.

**Verdicts:**
| Q | Verdict |
|---|---------|
| ≥80 | HOWL |
| ≥50 | WAG |
| ≥38.2 | GROWL |
| <38.2 | BARK |

**Confidence:** Always ≤ 61.8% (φ⁻¹). Combines Shannon entropy, Bayesian inference, and calibration.
